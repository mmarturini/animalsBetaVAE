# animalsBetaVAE

The β variational autoencoder (β-VAE) is a modification of the VAE framework that is able to automatically discover 
human-interpretable factorised latent representations from raw image data in a completely unsupervised manner.
This framework has been successfully applied on human faces and other datasets ([β-VAE: Learning basic visual concepts with a constrained variational framework](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Sy2fzU9gl))
and it has been used as a model for how the brain of macaques perceives faces ([Unsupervised deep learning identifies semantic disentanglement in single inferotemporal face patch neurons](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26751-5)).
In this project I reviewed this architecture and applied it to a dataset of cat faces to analyze whether it was able to learn disentangled and human interpretable latent factors on non-human faces.
